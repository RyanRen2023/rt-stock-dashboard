# **CST 8916 Assignment 1: Designing a Real-time Stock Market Monitoring Application with REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets**

## Introduction**
- Overview of the project
- Objectives of the application
- Importance of real-time stock market monitoring


## Section 1: REST and GraphQL for Data Requests and Updates
- **Explain** how both REST and GraphQL could be used to handle the data requests and updates required by the system.
    - For REST, describe how different endpoints could be structured, and how requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` would manage data.
    - For GraphQL, describe how queries and mutations could handle the same data operations and how this approach differs from REST.

- **Compare** the pros and cons of using REST versus GraphQL for your specific use case.

## Section 2: WebSockets for Real-time Communication
- **Describe** how WebSockets could be used to handle real-time communication in your chosen system.


- **Discuss** how WebSockets differ from REST and GraphQL in managing real-time data flow.

## Section 3: Technology Recommendation and Justification
- **Recommend** which technology (or combination of technologies) you would choose for your system: REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, or a hybrid approach.
    - Justify your recommendation based on your analysis in Sections 1 and 2.
    - Consider factors such as data complexity, real-time requirements, scalability, and ease of use for developers.

- **Explain** why this combination is best suited for your use case in terms of performance, scalability, and real-time capabilities.
